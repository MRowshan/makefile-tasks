# makefile-tasks

Write
 a Makefile that will delete all .txt documents in the current directory.



Write
 a Makefile that will echo text into a document.



Write
 a Makefile that will read a file, and print only its contents to the terminal, not the command used.



Write
 a Makefile that has a variable called MESSAGE. When make is run, print the message.



Write
 a Makefile that gets the current git hash from a shell command, and print only the hash to the command line, not the command to print.



Create
 one Makefile that does all of the above, and the file to write and read from is the same, and can be specified in the command. Writing to the file has to be run before reading, and cleaning should happen before any command. If make is ran with no arguments,
 write the file. The contents should be commented.



Using
 a Makefile, print the home directory of the user.



Using
 the same Makefile, print the home of the user if it includes the letter Z, if not throw an error.



Print
 where a variable was defined - i.e. was it in file? an environment variable? Or command line?



When
 is a variable expanded? Can you force it to be expanded earlier?
